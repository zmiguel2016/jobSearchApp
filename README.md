This web app was built to help keep track of my job application process. It features a current listing of jobs using the GitHub job restAPI which can be added to a user's list of jobs they are applying to. From there the user and keep track of what step they are in the application process like when they applied or when their next interview is. There is also a function to add jobs that you apply to from other sites just by entering the basic information about the job posting.
